# 🎁 GiftMuse 
~Gifts That Think. Bundles That Feel.

**GiftMuse** is an emotionally intelligent agentic tool designed to generate personalized gifting bundles powered by AI. Built with clarity, fallback logic, and cinematic UX, it transforms gifting into a trust-first experience—where every bundle feels intentional, and every suggestion carries emotional weight.

## 🌟 Ideatory Intention

GiftMuse was born from a simple question:  
**Can AI help us gift not just objects, but meaning?**

In hackathons and real-world use cases, gifting often feels transactional. GiftMuse reimagines it as a thoughtful ritual—powered by prompt logic, trust scores, and fallback flows that ensure every suggestion is relevant, inclusive, and emotionally resonant.

This project reflects my personal build philosophy:
- **Clarity-first UX**  
- **Modular, fallback-resilient architecture**  
- **Reviewer-grade storytelling and demo impact**  
- **Empowerment through emotionally intelligent design**
